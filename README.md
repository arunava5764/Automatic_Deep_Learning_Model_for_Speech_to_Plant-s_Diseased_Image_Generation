# Automatic_Deep_Learning_Model_for_Speech_to_Plant-s_Diseased_Image_Generation

This project has invented an unique idea of creating diseased leaf image from the decription of a healthy leaf. The interesting fact is that the discreption will be given to the model as an audio format. In this experiment we have used word2vec model for audio to text description, then minDALL-e for text description to image generation and at last cycle GAN for creating morphed image using the actual output image of GAN.
